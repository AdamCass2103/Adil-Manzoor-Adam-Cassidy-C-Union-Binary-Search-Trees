# Adil-Manzoor-Adam-Cassidy-C-Union-Binary-Search-Trees# C++Union — Binary Search Trees  
By **Adam Cassidy** and **Adil Manzoor**

This project is our CA2 submission for Algorithms & Data Structures.  
We implemented a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++ and created a teaching screencast explaining:

- What a BST is  
- Why BSTs are useful  
- How insert, search, traversal and deletion work  
- Performance using Big-O notation  
- Trade-offs compared to other data structures  

Below is the documentation for the project.
